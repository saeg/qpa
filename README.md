# Quantum Software Analysis Project

This project provides an automated framework and toolchain for analyzing the source code of popular quantum computing libraries to identify recurring software patterns. It uses `just` as a command runner to orchestrate the entire pipeline, from data collection to final analysis and reporting.

The project features a **dynamic discovery workflow**: it queries the GitHub API to find relevant quantum software projects, clones them, preprocesses their code (including Jupyter Notebooks), and then runs a series of analysis scripts to extract and classify core programming concepts.

## 📊 Experimental Data & Results

### Complete Experimental Datasets

For full reproducibility and transparency, all experimental data is available in the `docs/experimental_data.md` file. This comprehensive dataset includes:

**Framework Concept Extractions:**
- **Table 2**: Complete Classiq Quantum Patterns (`data/classiq_quantum_concepts.csv`)
- **Table 3**: Complete PennyLane Quantum Patterns (`data/pennylane_quantum_concepts.csv`) 
- **Table 4**: Complete Qiskit Quantum Patterns (`data/qiskit_quantum_concepts.csv`)

**Pattern Analysis Results:**
- **Table 5**: Top 10 Most Frequently Matched Quantum Concepts (`data/report/top_matched_concepts.csv`)
- Match Type Analysis (`data/report/match_type_counts.csv`)
- Framework Analysis (`data/report/matches_by_framework.csv`)
- Pattern Frequency Analysis (`data/report/patterns_by_match_count.csv`)

**Pattern Atlas Data:**
- Complete list of quantum patterns from PlanQK Pattern Atlas (`data/quantum_patterns.json`)
- Pattern metadata including names, aliases, intents, and descriptions

### Generate Experimental Data Report

To generate the complete experimental data report:

```bash
just experimental-data
```

This creates `docs/experimental_data.md` with all datasets, properly formatted for academic use with row numbers and complete data (not just summaries).

### Key Findings

The analysis reveals several important patterns in quantum software development:

1. **Framework-Specific Patterns**: Each quantum framework (Qiskit, PennyLane, Classiq) exhibits distinct conceptual patterns
2. **Cross-Framework Similarities**: Common patterns emerge across different frameworks
3. **Pattern Adoption**: How quantum patterns are adopted across different projects
4. **Concept Frequency**: Most frequently used quantum computing concepts



## 🛠 Project Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.12+**
*   **Just**: A modern command runner. If you don't have it, you can find installation instructions [here](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).
*   **Git**: For cloning the target repositories.
*   **A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**: The discovery script requires a GitHub token to avoid API rate limits. Create a token and save it in a `.env` file in the project root:

    ```text
    # in .env file
    GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_YourTokenHere"
    ```

## Replication Workflow: Step-by-Step Guide

This guide walks you through the exact sequence of commands to set up the project and replicate the study's results.

### Step 0: Initial Project Setup

This single command prepares the entire project. It will:
1.  Discover and clone the target quantum software repositories from GitHub.
2.  Create a unified virtual environment (`.venv`).
3.  Install all required Python dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
4.  Install the cloned `qiskit` and `pennylane` repositories in editable mode.

```bash
just install
```
*Note: This command is designed to be fully reproducible and will re-run the setup each time to ensure a clean state. The initial run will take significant time and disk space.*

### Step 1: Download Quantum Pattern Definitions

This step fetches the list of known quantum software patterns from the PlanQK Pattern Atlas, which will be used as a baseline for classification.

```bash
just download_pattern_list
```

### Step 2: Extract Core Concepts from Frameworks

Next, run the scripts that parse the source code of Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq to identify their core concepts (e.g., functions and classes).

```bash
just identify-concepts
```

This command generates the following raw data files in the `data/` directory, which you will use in the next step:
*   `data/classiq_quantum_concepts.csv`
*   `data/pennylane_quantum_concepts.csv`
*   `data/qiskit_quantum_concepts.csv`

### Step 3: Manual Concept Classification (Optional)

This is the only manual step in the workflow. The goal is to classify the concepts extracted in the previous step. You have two options:

*   **To replicate our exact results:** You don't need to do anything. The pre-classified files are already provided in the `data/` directory:
    *   `data/enriched_classiq_quantum_patterns.csv`
    *   `data/enriched_pennylane_quantum_patterns.csv`
    *   `data/enriched_qiskit_quantum_patterns.csv`

*   **To perform your own classification:**
    1.  Open the `_quantum_concepts.csv` files generated in Step 2.
    2.  Add your classification data to the rows.
    3.  Save the modified files with the `enriched_` prefix (e.g., `data/enriched_qiskit_quantum_patterns.csv`).

### Step 4.0: Download list of repost from Github
src/preprocessing/github_search.py

### Step 4.1: Preprocess Jupyter Notebooks

This step finds all Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) within the cloned projects, converts them to Python scripts (`.ipynb.py`) in-place for analysis, and creates an organized archive of the original notebooks.

```bash
just preprocess-notebooks
```

```bash
just convert_notebooks
```

### Step 5: Run the Main Semantic Analysis

With all data prepared, this command runs the main workflow. It uses the `enriched_*.csv` files and the preprocessed source code to search for quantum computing concepts across all target projects.

```bash
just run_main
```

### Step 6: Generate the Final Report

Finally, generate the final report summarizing the findings of the analysis.

```bash
just report
```

This will create the final output files:
- `data/final_pattern_report.txt` - Text summary report
- `docs/final_pattern_report.md` - Markdown report
- `data/report/` - Individual CSV tables for detailed analysis

### Step 7: Generate Experimental Data Report

Generate the complete experimental data report with all datasets:

```bash
just experimental-data
```

This creates `docs/experimental_data.md` with complete datasets for reproducibility.
