 1- Run the script todDownload list of patterns from https://patternatlas.planqk.de/pattern-languages/af7780d5-1f97-4536-8da7-4194b093ab1d website.
 2- Run the github script that will search for projects and clone the all the target respositories
 3- Run the script that extracts concepts classiq, pennylance and qiskit. The output should be three csv and json files.
 The file we will to do the classification are the csvs:
 data/pennylane_quantum_concepts.csv
 data/qiskit_quantum_concepts.csv
 data/classiq_quantum_concepts.csv


 4- Load each csv file generated by step 3 and classify the concepts extracted from the frameworks.
 Classify concepts manually and save the results of the csv in the data folder.
 If you want to use our classification, you don't need to do anything, as the files with the classification are already in the data folder.
 They are:
        - data/enriched_classiq_quantum_patterns.csv
        - data/enriched_pennylane_quantum_patterns.csv
        - data/enriched_qiskit_quantum_patterns.csv

  5- Run the code that searches for notebooks in the repositories and saves them in a separate folder
  6- Run the tool that converts the notebooks into plain python files
 7 - Run the semantic tool to search for quantum computing concepts in the target github projects
  8 - Run the tool that generates the final report
  The final report will be generated and saved in the data folder:
    data/final_pattern_report.txt
